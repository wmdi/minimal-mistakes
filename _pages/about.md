I am a senior student from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I have a broad interest in computer systems and compilers, especially for emerging applications. My current research focuses on optimizing distributed DL training.
